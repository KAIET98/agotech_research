# How to build the package

In order to install this packages information, please locate yourself in via terminal in this file's location and run: 

```
pip install .
```

# How to import it


Make sure that whenever you want to use it, you should make this import: 

```
from parameters.parameters import *
```

This makes a lot of sense as, first, inside this package, we wnter the parameters folder, next the parameters python file and finally we extract its information.
